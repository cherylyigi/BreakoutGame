Breakout! made by Jieying Lin

Pass two arguments to run the game: the first one is FPS(10-60), and the second one is the ball speed(1-10).
Press A to move the paddle left, D to move right, W to move up, S to move down.
Press Q to quit Game, Press R after fail to retry.

Each brick has two lives; the ball needs to hit it twice to kill it.
When the first time hit the brick, it will become red.
All key presses support lowercase and uppercase letters.
Retry or reload after clean will make ball show up in the left top corner again because it doesn't make sense that the ball shows up in the middle of the bricks.
The paddle can move, but it is restricted in some regions.
